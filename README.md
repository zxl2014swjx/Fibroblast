Dissecting fibroblast heterogeneity with single-cell RNA-seq

**Abstract:**
Fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population of cells that exist in many human tissues and play a wide range of roles. The heterogeneity of fibroblasts is increasingly appreciated, but the origins and functions of distinct fibroblast subtypes remain poorly understood. Here we curated fibroblast cells from 16 studies covering the majority of human tissues across different developmental stages. We harmonized the single-cell RNA seq data, constructed the fibroblast landscape, and explored the regulatory mechanisms during disease progression. As a result, we identified novel fibroblast subtypes that had various tissue specificities. For the trajectory, we employed three different methods to demonstrate the Development and Activate Fibroblast was the root of evolution. We also found that most fibroblast subtypes were enriched in epithelial mesenchyme transformation and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating the cytoskeleton and metabolism function of the subtypes in the cellular microenvironment. The fibroblast played an essential role in complex traits including anthropometric, immune, and metabolic classification. Moreover, the malignant fibroblast subtypes were significantly correlated with poor survival in many cancer types. The ecotypes discovery in single-cell RNA-seq and recovered by TCGA bulk RNA-seq robustly were found correlated with aneuploidy and tumor mutation burden. Additionally, we predicted some curable drug of these ecotypes. Taken together, these findings linked stromal evolution from distinct cells of origin to transcriptional heterogeneity among fibroblasts and demonstrated unique functions for fibroblasts of a defined cellular origin, providing insights into the formation of heterogeneity and clinical treatment.
