**Title:**
A systematic characterization of fibroblast subtypes and heterogeneity

**Running title:**
Dissecting fibroblast heterogeneity with scRNA-seq

**Abstract:**
Fibroblasts represent a group of cells that play pivotal roles in development, disease, and treatment outcomes. While their heterogeneity is increasingly explored, the origins and functions of distinct fibroblast subtypes remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive fibroblast landscape by integrating large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) datasets spanning 60 major human organs and tissues across various developmental stages and biological conditions. We identified 16 fibroblast subtypes, including nine known and seven novel subtypes, and systematically characterized their tissue specificities, transcriptional heterogeneity, and cell states. Our trajectory analyses unveiled diverse paths of fibroblast differentiations, with subtypes DevFB (developmental fibroblast) and ProFB (proliferation fibroblasts) positioned upstream of the fibroblast evolution. Exploration of these fibroblast subtypes during development revealed that most subtypes have unique pluripotency and cellular senescence features. Using our well-defined subtype catalog, we demonstrated that different fibroblast subtypes were associated with various complex traits such as anthropometric and immune diseases. Furthermore, analysis using the subtype-specific gene activities in bulk cancer data revealed that myoCAF was a risk factor for patient survival. Collectively, our study provides a comprehensive fibroblast atlas, offering insights into the functions, heterogeneity, and clinical applications of fibroblast subtypes.
